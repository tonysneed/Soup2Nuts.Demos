Trackable Client Entities ReadMe

NOTE: You should first install the Entity Framework Power Tools.
Support for EF 6.1 Tools for Visual Studio has be added, but it can
only be used to generate client entities using a .NET 4.5 class
library project, from which you can copy or link model classes
to the Client.Entities project.

This project template references the TrackableEntities.Client NuGet
package, which contains a ChangeTrackingCollection<T> that sets the
TrackingState and ModifiedProperties properties on each entity.

To get started, right-click on the project, select Entity Framework,
Reverse Engineer Code First.  The tool will generate classes for
data context and mapping classes, as well as trackable client entities.

IMPORTANT: After running the tool, be sure to delete the Mapping folder
and classes, and also the DbContext-derived class that was generated.
These must be removed because the project will not reference the
Entity Framework NuGet package.  Clients should avoid referencing
any particular data access library and instead invoke a service
for retrieving and saving entities to a database.

This project is based on a portable class library and can be referenced
from clients based on .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5, Windows Phone 8 and higher, 
or Windows Store Apps.
